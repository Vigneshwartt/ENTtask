You would have used httprouter to handle the rotues earlier in GORM exercise like below.

```
import	"github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter"
	router := httprouter.New()
	addRootRoutes(router)
    handler := newHandlerWrapper(router, '/api', middleware)
	handler.GET("/test", testHandler)
```

Here in this exercise you need to use mux router
